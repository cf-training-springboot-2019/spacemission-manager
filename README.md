## Getting Started

To quickly run the application simply execute spring-boot mvn plugin's **run** goal. This action most be performed from the project's root directory by using the following command in a terminal of your choosing.
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

An alternative method would be through the creation of an OCI image by executing the plugin's build-image goal.
This image can then be used to run a standalone docker container by using the following command sequence
```
mvn spring-boot:build-image
docker run -d --name [container-name] -p 8080:8080 ${docker.registry}/${project.artifactId}:v${project.version}
```
